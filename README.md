## Overview of the school district analysis ##

The "students_complete.csv showed evidence of academic dishonesty in reading and math grades for Thomas High School  ninth grades appear to have been altered. Therefore Maria wants us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Also after replacing the scores Maria wants us to repeat teh school district analysis and write a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results ##
- In district summary, we noticed that Thomas High School 9th graders were contributing towards increasing the passing percentage. Now that we are not including Thomas High School 9th graders the passing percentage dropped.
